The game started in frenetic fashion, as City were denied a penalty at one end, before Liverpool raced away on the counter-attack to take the lead through Fabinho's stunning strike from distance. While it did seem as though Alexander-Arnold handled the ball in the build-up to the goal, replays suggested that Silva might also have handballed it for City. The hosts pushed on after that breakthrough and quickly doubled their lead through Salah's header. The rest of the half then saw City squander many chances to halve the deficit. The second period opened with Liverpool extending their lead through Mane's powerful header at the back post, and from there it was difficult for City to recover. They eventually pulled a goal back through Silva's smart finish, but it was too late to truly worry Liverpool and the hosts held on for victory amidst a tempestuous ending.  ",
